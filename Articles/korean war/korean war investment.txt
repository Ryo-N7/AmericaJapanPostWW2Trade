Foreign currency derived from U.S. Army and military personnel reached gigantic
sums for those times: $590 million in 1951 and over $800 million both in 1952
and in 1953. Thus, Japan obtained a temporary dollar income that amounted to 60
to 70 percent of its exports and that is to say, Japan was enabled to import at the
rate of about $2 billion per year. To the Japanese economy, which had been
doing its level best just to import something less than one billion dollars’ worth of
goods in 1949 and 1950, $2 billion in imports meant that the key industries which
depended on imports of raw materials could virtually double their scale of
production and firms which were extremely anxious to expand production could
obtain the imports needed to support a much larger scale of activity.
